                <img src="media/pic1.JPG" alt="Niagara Falls Picture 1">
                <p>This is a picture I took on a trip to Niagara Falls. It is a picture of the rocks at the base of the falls and I really like about this picture is the bird that flew into frame as I took the picture because it truly makes it a one of a kind shot.</p>

                <img src="media/pic2.JPG" alt="Niagara Falls Picture 2">
                <p>This is another picture I took on a trip to Niagara Falls. It is a picture of the falls with the boat "Maid of The Mist" on the water. It really emphasizes the name due to the fact that the boat is encased within the mist in the photo.</p>

                <img src="media/pic3.JPG" alt="Woods Picture 1">
                <p>This is a picture I took on the RIT Campus in the woods where there are often deer, and I was luckily able to get up close to get this picture of it looking right at me.</p>

                <img src="media/pic4.JPG" alt="Woods Picture 2">
                <p>This is another picture I took in the woods that day. This one is of a nice little chipmunk. These little guys are not easy to get pictures of because of how fast they move and will flee any movement.</p>

                <img src="media/pic5.JPG" alt="Snowboarding Picture 1">
                <p>This is a picture I took on a trip a local mountain in my home state of Pennsylvania. Me and a couple friends went on a day off of school and I was able to get a great shot of my friend Tyler doing a nice boardslide across the rainbow rail.</p>

                <img src="media/pic6.JPG" alt="Snowboarding Picture 2">
                <p>This is another picture I took on that trip to the mountain. This one is again of Tyler but this time I got him doing a real nice nose grab off this spine. I edited the picture to be black and white but left the color of the board to stand out.</p>
